He has a huge experience and a large number of rescued people behind his back: he worked during terrorist attacks, persuaded hostages to be released, dissuaded criminals and victims from committing a fatal act. Over the years in the profession, Maximov has developed his own unique method of negotiating. But even a seemingly perfect employee makes mistakes. In the past, Maksimov, negotiating with terrorists who seized the school, is defeated — his daughter is killed. Unable to look into the eyes of his wife and son, Alexander leaves the family. Years later, the hero again encounters the culprit of that tragedy — it turns out that the attacker did not die during the explosion at that school and now throws Maximov a new challenge.</p>",1675622941,https://api.tvmaze.com/shows/63126,https://api.tvmaze.com/episodes/2423289,,,,,,,,,,,,
